Change your keyboard type. For example, If you use JIS keyboard and set keyboard type 37 on preference window, your typing recognized as US keyboard.
I will maintain it until Karabiner works on macOS Sierra.

It provide only changing keyboard type, not contain replacing keys.
If you want to use JIS keyboard as US keyboard on MacBook, you need to replace ```JAPANESE YEN``` to ```Backquote``` via another application.

## USAGE
